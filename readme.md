## Sleeknote test

This is a basic example project so you have the structure to start coding, it is a simplification of our real environment.
To get it running just execute the following command in the root of the project.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

now you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to test your code.

Feel free to add/remove/modify the files in here.

This is your playground!

## How it works

We use hyperHTML to render our layout, more info on how it works here: https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/#essentials-01

But don't worry, you dont need to be an expert. For now, the only important this is that you can find the main html of the app in `app.js` file.
